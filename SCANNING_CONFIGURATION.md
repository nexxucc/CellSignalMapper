# Optimal Scanning Configuration for Drone-Based LTE Signal Mapping

## Configuration Summary

**Integration Time:** 1.0 seconds (optimal for mobile LTE mapping)
**Scan Interval:** 0.5 seconds (optimal spatial resolution)
**Flight Duration:** 15 minutes (auto-stop, configurable)

---

## Why These Settings Are Optimal

### Integration Time: 1.0 seconds

**Technical Reasoning:**
- RTL-SDR's rtl_power tool requires minimum 1 second integration
- LTE signals are continuous and strong (-60 to -110 dBm typically)
- Moving platform prioritizes **spatial coverage** over **integration depth**
- Longer integration (5-10s) is for weak/noisy signals at static locations

**What happens with different settings:**
- **0.5s or less:** rtl_power won't work (minimum is 1s)
- **5-10s:** Good for static surveys, BAD for drone mapping
  - Drone travels 25-50m during each scan
  - Creates gaps in spatial coverage
  - Reduces total number of samples
  - Poor heatmap interpolation

**Research Evidence:**
- RTL-SDR articles recommend 5-15 minute integration for **static location surveys**
- For **mobile mapping** (driving/flying), frequent snapshots are better
- LTE cell towers transmit continuously at high power - don't need deep integration

### Scan Interval: 0.5 seconds

**Performance Analysis:**
```
RTL-SDR scan:     ~1.2s  (rtl_power with 1s integration)
GPS read:         ~0.1s  (non-blocking MAVLink read)
Data logging:     ~0.05s (in-memory append)
Sleep interval:   0.5s   (configurable wait time)
─────────────────────────────
Total cycle:      ~1.85s per scan
```

**Spatial Coverage:**
```
Typical drone speed:  5-10 m/s
Sample spacing:       9-18 meters (excellent for heatmap)
15-min flight:        ~487 scans
Total measurements:   ~12.2 million frequency points
```

**Why 0.5s is optimal:**
- Provides sample every 9-18 meters at typical drone speeds
- Excellent spatial resolution for interpolation
- Not too fast (scanning takes 1.2s anyway)
- Not too slow (would create gaps in coverage)

### Flight Duration: 15 minutes (auto-stop)

**Battery Considerations:**
- Typical quadcopter flight time: 15-20 minutes
- Leave margin for takeoff/landing: 2-4 minutes
- Data collection time: ~11-15 minutes

**New Auto-Stop Feature:**
```bash
# Default: Auto-stops after 15 minutes
python src/main.py --mode continuous

# Custom duration (e.g., 10 minutes for shorter battery)
python src/main.py --mode continuous --duration 10

# Custom duration (e.g., 20 minutes for larger battery)
python src/main.py --mode continuous --duration 20
```

**Benefits:**
- No need to watch the clock during flight
- Prevents battery drain (can land before auto-stop)
- Consistent data collection periods
- Safe operation (auto-stops before battery critical)

## Flight Procedure (Updated)

### Pre-Flight Checklist
1. ✓ RTL-SDR V4 connected via USB
2. ✓ Pixhawk connected via USB (/dev/ttyACM0)
3. ✓ GPS module has clear sky view (go outside!)
4. ✓ Battery charged for 15+ minutes
5. ✓ Verify config: `config/config.yaml`

### Flight Steps
```bash
# 1. Start data collection (auto-stops after 15 min)

## Why NOT Use Longer Integration Times?

### Common Misconception
**"Longer integration time = better signal quality"**

This is TRUE for **static location** spectrum surveys, but FALSE for **mobile signal mapping**.

### Comparison Table

| Setting | Static Survey | Mobile Mapping (Drone) |
|---------|---------------|------------------------|
| **Integration Time** | 5-15 minutes | 1 second |
| **Goal** | Deep signal averaging | Spatial coverage |
| **Signal Type** | Weak/intermittent | Strong/continuous (LTE) |
| **Platform** | Fixed location | Moving at 5-10 m/s |
| **Output** | Detailed spectrum | Coverage heatmap |

### Example: What happens with 10s integration on drone

```
Integration time:   10 seconds
Drone speed:        10 m/s
Distance per scan:  100 meters!
15-min flight:      ~90 scans (vs 487 with 1s)
Total points:       ~2.25M (vs 12.2M with 1s)
Coverage:           Sparse, large gaps
Heatmap quality:    Poor (insufficient interpolation points)
```

**Result:** Terrible heatmap with holes and poor interpolation.

### Why 1s is Sufficient for LTE

LTE cell tower signals are:
- **Continuous:** Always transmitting (not intermittent)
- **Strong:** Typically -60 to -110 dBm (not weak)
- **Stable:** Minimal variation over short timescales
- **Purpose-built:** Designed for mobile reception

**Conclusion:** 1 second integration captures full signal strength. Longer integration doesn't improve accuracy for LTE, only reduces spatial coverage.

## Advanced Configuration

### For Longer Flights (20+ minutes)
```bash
python src/main.py --mode continuous --duration 20
```

### For Shorter Flights (10 minutes)
```bash
python src/main.py --mode continuous --duration 10
```

### Disable Auto-Stop (Manual control only)
```bash
# Set very long duration (e.g., 999 minutes)
python src/main.py --mode continuous --duration 999
# Then press Ctrl+C when ready to land
```

### Test Run (2 minutes for testing)
```bash
python src/main.py --mode continuous --duration 2
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Flight duration too short, not enough data"
**Solution:** Increase duration
```bash
python src/main.py --mode continuous --duration 20
```

### Issue: "Battery died before auto-stop"
**Solution:** Reduce duration or press Ctrl+C early
```bash
python src/main.py --mode continuous --duration 12
# OR just press Ctrl+C when battery warning appears
```

### Issue: "Gaps in heatmap coverage"
**Causes:**
- Flying too fast (slow down to 5-8 m/s)
- Integration time too long (verify it's 1.0s)
- GPS dropouts (check satellite count)

**Solutions:**
- Fly slower and more deliberately
- Verify config.yaml: `integration_time: 1.0`
- Ensure clear GPS line-of-sight

### Issue: "Too much data, file too large"
**This is normal!** 12M measurements = 3-6 MB JSON
- JSON is compressed efficiently
- Visualization handles large datasets
- Use visualization mode to create lightweight HTML
